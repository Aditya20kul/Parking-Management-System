					*** PARKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM ***


  Hello all, 

	This is a basic c++ project created by me in order to get familiar with the language and its different functionalities.

  The project also makes use of FILE HANDLING IN C++ ,This program lets the user to -- 

  1. Register a new vehicle into parking lot. 

  2. Delete the entry of a particular vehicle.

  3. Find a vehicle by entering the name of customer.

  4. Find a vehicle by entering the number of vehicle.

  5. Display the status of Parking lot.

		Whenever a new vehicle is REGISTERED or an exsisting vehicle is REMOVED ,the details are entered into the file along with the time of entry/exit .

Any changes/fixes/suggestions regarding the program are welcomed ! 
KEEP CODING!!

THANK YOU,
ADITYA KULKARNI.
